| 6 | Array | [42. Trapping Rain Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/) | [Code](dsa/Array/trapping-rain-water.java) | Yes | two pointer(without space) | Yes | store max left & right heigh for every index then caculate trap water |
| 7 | Array | [Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/description.) | [Code](dsa/Array/MoveZeros.java) | Yes | Two Pointer | Yes | Count zeros and if count>0 then swap number by that much index |
| 8 | Array | [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/.) | [Code](dsa/Array/TwoSum.java) | Yes | HashMap (Complement Pattern) | No | Use map to store num[i],index. |
| 9 | LinkedList | [160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/) | [Code](dsa/LinkedList/intersection-of-two-linked-lists.java) | Yes | Two Pointer | No | As both length is diff if we start traversing another list then both will be at intersection |
| 10 | LinkedList | [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/) | [Code](dsa/LinkedList/reverse-linked-list.java) | Yes | Two Pointer | No | two point prev & curr swap one link at a time |
| 11 | LinkedList | [83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/description/) | [Code](dsa/LinkedList/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list.java) | Yes | Two Pointer | No | two pointer= link the nodes if not match |
| 12 | recursion | [39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/description/) | [Code](dsa/recursion/combination-sum.java) | Yes | backtracking | Yes | same pattern pick not pick just we can pick same element mutiple time  so not inc that time Also handle other cases |
| 13 | recursion | [40. Combination Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/) | [Code](dsa/recursion/combination-sum-iI.java) | Yes | backtracking | Yes | - |
| 14 | recursion | [78. Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/description/) | [Code](dsa/recursion/find_Subsets.java) | Yes | backtracking | Yes | subsequence pattern to pick and not pick current element dual recursion call |
